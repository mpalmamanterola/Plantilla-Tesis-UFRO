Groundwater has a very close relationship with human society and is being highly used by people thanks to its
high quality and quantity, the problem lies when these are not monitored and are persistently looted by industries. The groundwater level continue to decrease due to overexploitation, it is for this reason that it is necessary to monitor the behavior of
warehouses with the aim of safeguarding both their quality and quantity. Although it is possible to carry out monitoring of pumping wells, it is not
feasible to supply observations throughout the national territory, it is expensive and late. To deal with this problem it is necessary to look for new alternatives for the study of
groundwater, one of them stands out above the others: The GRACE satellite, a satellite that manages to capture the change in water levels through gravitational differences with unparalleled precision,
the only drawback lies in its low spatial resolution, so the information it provides is very
widespread. Based on this, a methodology is adopted to apply an increase in spatial resolution of GRACE to obtain monthly gridded products at high resolution with the
objective of obtaining behaviors in a more granular way facilitating the study. The resolution increase is through a \textit{Machine Learning} algorithm that works well in these cases
due to the rectangular dynamics of the data, this is the \textit{Random Forest} model that, through high-resolution explanatory hydrological variables, manages to predict
the dynamics of GRACE. Thus, obtaining the grilled products it is possible to validate tendentially
high-resolution behaviors using \textit{in situ} observations, high-resolution GRACE, and average precipitation.

Finally, regarding the areas where there is a high variance in the increase in resolution, it is concluded that said increase in the additional is inherited from the explanatory variables used for the prediction.
