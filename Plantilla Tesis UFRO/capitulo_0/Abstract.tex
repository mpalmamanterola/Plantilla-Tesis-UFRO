Groundwater has a very close relationship with human society and is being highly used by people thanks to its
high quality and quantity, the problem lies when these are not monitored and are persistently looted by industries. water content
underground, due to overexploitation, causes its levels to continue to decrease. It is for this reason that it is necessary to monitor the behavior of
warehouses with the aim of safeguarding both the quality and quantity of the water. Although it is possible to carry out monitoring of pumping basins, it is not
possible to supply measurement throughout the national territory, it is expensive and late. With this problem it is necessary to look for new alternatives for the study of
groundwater, one of them stands out above the others: The GRACE satellite, a satellite that manages to capture the change in water levels through gravitational differences with unparalleled precision,
the only drawback lies in its low spatial resolution, so the information it provides is very
Based on this, a methodology is adopted to apply an increase in spatial resolution of GRACE to obtain monthly gridded products at high resolution with the
objective of obtaining behaviors in a more granular way facilitating the study. The resolution increase is through a \textit{Machine Learning} algorithm that works well in these cases
Due to the rectangular dynamics of the data, this is the \textit{Random Forest} model that, through high-resolution explanatory hydrological variables, manages to predict in a good way
GRACE dynamics. Thus, obtaining grilled products is possible to validate tendentially
behaviors at high resolution through \textit{in situ} observations and subsequently determine those areas where there is a greater extraction of water in order to carry out actions in this regard.
Finally, regarding the coincidences between the time series, it is concluded that the trends at high and low resolution for the entire territory are coincident as well as in a particular region.
